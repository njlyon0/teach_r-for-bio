Ask a question\n    2. Make a hypothesis (educated guess for answer to question)\n    3. Test hypothesis with experiment\n    4. Analyze data to test hypothesis\n    5. Report results\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- \"Statistics\" is what we do with our data to test our hypotheses!\n    - I.e., whether we find support for our hypothesis or not\n\n## [Statistics Justification Example]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- Hypothesis: adding Nitrogen (N) to soil will make sunflowers grow taller\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Test: Grow many sunflowers either <u>with</u> or <u>without</u> adding a set amount of N to the soil\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Data: After set number of days, measure height of all sunflowers\n\n. . .\n\n![](images/sunflower-hypothesis.png){.absolute top=450 left=750 width=\"40%\"}\n\n## [Stats Example Continued]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- How do we decide whether adding N to the soil resulted in taller sunflowers?\n    - What difference in height would be \"enough\" to say whether we were right?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- What if _some_ of the +N sunflowers are _shorter_ than some of the regular sunflowers?\n    - Does this mean our hypothesis isn't supported?\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- We need to use a statistical test to evaluate our hypothesis! \n\n## [Statistics' Role in Science]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- Statistical tests let us know whether or not our hypothesis is supported\n    - These tests include some assumptions but they are well-documented\n\n\\\n\n. . . \n\n- Scientists assess the appropriateness of the statistics in _the same way they do_ for experimental design\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- A perfect experiment with inappropriate statistics is <u>not good science</u>\n\n## [Data Science & Statistics]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n- Today is <u>**_not_**</u> a deep dive into the math behind statistics!\n    - There are whole classes devoted to that\n\n\\\n\n. . . \n\n- Professional data scientists have to look at data and pick an appropriate test\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- In this class we’ll:\n    - 1. Look at some typical test types\n    - 2. Cover what data types are the best fit for each test\n\n## [Data Science & Statistics Analogy]{.orange}\n\n- Statisticians are like artists\n- Data scientists are like art historians\n\n\\\n\n. . .\n\n- Data scientists recognize art and can talk about it but we _may or may not_ be artists ourselves!\n\n## [Temperature Check]{.purple}\n\n#### How are you Feeling?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"comics/debugging.png\" alt=\"Comic-style graph depicting someone's emotional state as they debug code (from initial struggle and defeat to eventual triumph)\">\n</p>\n\n## [Hypothesis Testing Philosophies]{.orange} {.smaller}\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n#### Null Hypothesis Testing\n\n1.
