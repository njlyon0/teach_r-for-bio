## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- R Packages
- Class vs. Structure
- Using Vectors
- Conditionals

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Load and use an R package
- Define the difference(s) between object <u>class</u> and <u>structure</u>
- Create and manipulate vectors
- Write conditional statements
- Manage missing data in objects with conditionals

## [R Package Background]{.orange} {.smaller}

- R [packages]{.purple} are groups of functions developed by users

\

. . .

- Packages have no defined depth or breadth requirements
    - A package could be a single, simple function
    - Or a complex ecosystem of inter-related functions

\

. . .

- Packages can be installed by any R user for _free!_

\

. . .

- R is versatile and powerful (in part) because of contributed packages

## [Package Locations]{.orange}

- There are two main homes for R packages

\

. . . 

1. Comprehensive R Archive Network
    - A.k.a. "CRAN" | [cran.rstudio.com](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

\

. . .

2. GitHub
    - [github.com](https://github.com/)

## [CRAN vs. GitHub]{.orange} {.smaller}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

#### CRAN

- Currently >20,000 packages live here

\

- Strict rules for packages to be allowed

\

- These are "official" packages

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

#### GitHub

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

#### GitHub

- Unknown number of packages here (no centralized record retained)

\

- No mandatory quality control tests to be available here

\

- Packages _usually_ work but they don't have the same quality control as CRAN packages

## [Using Packages]{.orange} {.smaller}

- In order to use a package, you must:

\

. . .

1. <u>Install</u> the desired package
    - Done once per computer

\

. . .

2. <u>Load</u> the package into R
    - Done _every_ time you re-open RStudio

## [Using Packages: Specific Steps]{.orange} {.smaller}

\

```{.r}
# Install desired package
install.packages("dplyr")

# Load that package
library(dplyr)
```

\

- `install.packages` <u>_requires_</u> the package name be in quotes

\

. . .

- `library` <u>_requires_</u> requires **unquoted** names.

## [Package Analogy]{.gold} {.smaller}

. . . 

- `install.packages` = buying a set of tools from the store and putting them in your home

\

. . .

- `library` = moving the tools that you already own to your workbench

\

. . .

- You only _buy_ the tools **once** but _every time_ you start work you need to bring them back to your work area!

## [Practice: Packages]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}

- Make a new script for this week's lecture!
    - Save it in your RStudio Project folder for this course
    - Make sure it has "lecture" and "2" in the file name

\

. . .

- Install the `palmerpenguins` package
    - Remember to put quotes around the package name!

\

. . .

- Load the package with the `library` function
    - Once loaded, run `?palmerpenguins` to see the package-level help file

## [Note on _Function_ Names]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Functions <u>_are not_</u> required to have unique names across all packages

\

. . .

- Risk of using a different function than intended
    - Best case: creates an error and forces you to catch the mistake
    - Worst case: _silently_ does something wrong

## [Function Namespacing]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Functions can be "[namespaced]{.purple}" to specify which package the function comes from

\

. . .

- Namespacing _guarantees_ you use the function from the desired package

\

. . .

- Done with two colons (:) between the package and function names
    - E.g., `package::function()`

## [Practice: Namespacing]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}
![](images/hex-dplyr.png){.absolute top=0 left=965 width="12%" fig-alt="dplyr R package hex logo"}

- `palmerpenguins` includes an example dataset on penguins

. . .

- Run the following code
    - `peng_df <- palmerpenguins::penguins`

\

. . .

- Install and load the `dplyr` package
    - `dplyr` has a function called `glimpse` that shows you core structures of data

\

. . .

- Namespace `glimpse` and run it on `peng_df`

## [Class versus Structure]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Objects have both [class]{.purple} and [structure]{.purple}

\

. . .

- [Class]{.purple} = the type of object it is
    - E.g., dataframe, integer, character, etc.

\

. . .

- [Structure]{.purple} = the dimensions and "shape" of the data
    - E.g., Number of rows / columns, length, etc.

\

. . .

- _Both_ class and structure affect what you can do with or to a given object!

## [Checking Class/Structure]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Best to **check class and structure** of an object to ensure functions will work

. . .

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

### Check Class

::::

## [Checking Class/Structure]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Best to **check class and structure** of an object to ensure functions will work

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

### Check Class

- Use the `class` function

\

```{.r}
# Checking class of 'my_obj'
class(my_obj)
```

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

### Check Structure

:::
::::

## [Checking Class/Structure]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Best to **check class and structure** of an object to ensure functions will work

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

### Check Class

- Use the `class` function

\

```{.r}
# Checking class of 'my_obj'
class(my_obj)
```

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

### Check Structure

- Use _either_ the `str` function _or_ `dplyr::glimpse`

```{.r}
# Checking structure of 'my_obj' (with base R)
str(my_obj)

# Checking structure of 'my_obj' (with `dplyr`)
dplyr::glimpse(my_obj)
```

:::
::::

## [Practice: Structure]{.pink} {.smaller}

- What is the [class]{.orange} of 'peng_df'?

\

. . .

- What is the [structure]{.orange}?
    - What information is included when you check?

\

. . .

- What happens when you check the class of a function?
    - Run `class(class)`

\

. . .

- What happens when you check the structure of a function?
    - Run `str(str)`

## [Using Vectors: Coordinates]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Vector structure is expressed as "[length]{.purple}"
    - Vector length = number of elements in the vector
    - Dataframe length = number of rows

\

. . .

- [Bracket notation]{.orange} can be used to navigate vectors

\

. . .


```{r bracket-demo-1}
#| echo: true

# Make a vector
my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

# Use bracket notation to retrieve one element
my_vec[3]
```

## [Using Vectors: Coordinates Cont.]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Bracket notation accepts vectors of coordinates

\

. . .

```{r bracket-demo-2}
#| echo: true

# Use bracket notation to retrieve several elements
my_vec[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

\

. . .

- You can also grab the same element _more than once!_

\

. . .

```{r bracket-demo-3}
#| echo: true

# Use bracket notation to retrieve one element multiple times
my_vec[c(1, 1, 1)]
```

## [Practice: Vector Navigation]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Base R has a built-in vector of letters called `letters`
    - Assign `letters` to an object called `my_vec`

\

. . .

- Check the length of `my_vec` using the `length` function

\

. . .
 
- Identify the 10^th^ element of `my_vec` using bracket notation

\

- Identify the 8^th^, 5^th^, 12^th^, 12^th^ (again), and 15^th^ elements of `my_vec`
    - Use concatenation inside of the brackets (with `c`)!

## [Conditionals]{.orange} {.smaller}

- You can write code that runs _only_ if an 'if statement' is true
    - Otherwise that chunk of code is skipped!

\

. . .

- This allows you to write flexible code that can handle any outcome that you can anticipate!
    - Particularly useful for subsetting data based on the contents of a column

\

. . .

- These 'if statements' are called [conditionals]{.purple}

\

. . .

- The answer to a conditional <u>_must_</u> be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`

## [Fundamentals: EQUAL]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Are two things exactly equal?

\

. . .

```{r conditional-equal}
#| echo: true

# Check a conditional
"hello" == "hello"
```

\

. . .

- Uses `==` operator
    - Just two equal signs

## [Fundamentals: OR]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Are _any_ of these conditions met?

\

. . .

```{r conditional-or}
#| echo: true

# Check either one conditional *or* the other
"hello" == "hello" | 2 == 7
```

\

. . .

- Uses `|` operator
    - Shift + `\` on keyboard


## [Fundamentals: AND]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Are _all_ of the conditions met?

\

. . .

```{r conditional-and}
#| echo: true

# Are *all* conditions TRUE?
"hello" == "hello" & 2 == 7
```

\

. . .

- Uses `&` operator
    - Shift + 7 on keyboard

## [Fundamentals: Summary]{.orange} {.smaller}

## [Practice: Fundamental Conditionals]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}

- We'll use the base R `subset` function with the `peng_df` object
    - If needed, consult the help file for more details (`?subset`)

\

. . .

- Subset `peng_df` to only Adelie penguins (and assign to a `sub_v1` object)
    - I.e., `species == "Adelie"`

\

. . .

- How many rows does that subset have?

## [More Practice: Fundamental Conditionals]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}

- Subset `peng_df` to Adelie _or_ Biscoe penguins
    - Assign this subset to `sub_v2` object

\

. . .

- Subset `peng_df` to only male Gentoo penguins
    - Assign to `sub_v3` object

\

. . .

- How many rows does _that_ subset have?

## [Discussion: Conditionals]{.gold} {.smaller}

- We've covered EQUAL, OR, and AND
    - `==`, `|`, or `&`

\

. . .

- What unanswered questions do you have?

\

. . .

- What other types of conditional statements would be useful?
    - Think about it in the context of wanting to subset some data

## [Numeric Conditionals]{.orange} {.smaller}

- For numbers, we can use greater/less than conditionals!

\

. . .

- Greater / less than are expressed as normal
    - `>` and `<`

\

. . .

- Adding 'or equal to' is done by adding an equal sign
    - `>=` and `<=`

## [Practice: Numeric Conditionals]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}

- Subset `peng_df` to only penguins with a bill length greater than 40 mm
    - Assign to `sub_v7`

\

. . . 

- Subset `peng_df` to only penguins with a body mass less than or equal to 4,000 g
    - Assign to `sub_v8`

# [Bonus Conditionals]{.orange}

## [OR with >2 Options]{.orange} {.smaller}

- OR conditionals with many options get cumbersome quickly
    - E.g., `x == 1 | x == 2 | x == 3 | x == 4 …`

\

. . .

-  We can use concatenation and the `%in%` operator to simplify this!

\

. . .

- `%in%` is effectively "if any of \<this vector\> matches the value"
    - E.g., `x %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, …)`

## [Conditionals: NOT]{.orange} {.smaller}

- You can also _exclude_ based on conditions
    - Two different ways of doing this

\

. . . 

- For one / a few options: use `!=` for "not equal to"
    - E.g., `x != 10`

\

. . . 

- Can be combined with `%in%` to exclude a set of options
    - E.g., `!x %in% c(...)`
    - Note the exclamation mark is _before_ the object

## [Practice: Advanced Conditionals]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="palmerpenguins R package hex logo"}

- Subset `peng_df` is species is any of "Adelie", "Gentoo", or "Chinstrap"
    - Use the `%in%` operator

\

. . .

- Subset `peng_df` to all islands except "Dream"
