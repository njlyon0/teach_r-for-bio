## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Muddiest Point Review
- Requesting Feedback with Google Forms
- Function Tutorials â€“ Draft 1 Presentations 

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Create a survey to get helpful feedback
- Explain R functions to an audience of your peers

## [Muddiest Point Review]{.gold}

- Recurring topics from most recent MPs:

\

. . . 

- What other topic(s) would you like to review?

## [Requesting Feedback]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Asking for feedback is a key part of any career
    - Especially in fields with a lot of teamwork / collaboration

\

. . .

- Designing surveys helps standardize responses
    - Questions with specific / narrow answer ranges give more actionable feedback

\

. . .

- Anonymous surveys reduce 'intimidation factor' for critical feedback
    - Greater response rate = more information to use for improvement

## [Feedback Conversation]{.gold} {.smaller}

- What experience do you have with requesting/getting feedback?
    - Classes? Work? Presentations?

\

. . .

- How helpful was the feedback that you've received?

\

. . .

- How could that feedback have been changed to be _more_ helpful?

## [Creating Surveys]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Consider the kind of feedback you want to receive
    - Specific
    - Actionable (I.e., something you can actually do to handle this)
    - Both positive & _constructively_ critical

\

. . .

- Phrase questions that give useful answers to you
    - E.g., "How was my speaking pace? Answers: 'too fast', 'just right', 'too slow'"

\

. . .

- [Imagine a useful piece of feedback then <u>write the question that prompts it</u>]{.purple}

## [Create a Survey]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Google Forms are great for this!
    - Free, familiar user interface, etc.

\

. . .

- Each of you will create a form to share with your peers today

\

. . .

- Your form should have (at least) questions about the following topics:
    1. Tutorial format
    2. Presentation style / pace
    3. Specific question / function (at least one)
    4. [Another topic you think would be valuable]{.gold}

## [Create a Survey Continued]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Once created, add me as a collaborator!
    - This will let me see feedback (necessary so I can moderate as/if needed)

\

. . .

- To add a collaborator on a Google Form:
    1. Click "Send" in the top right
    2. Click "Add editor" in bottom left of resulting page
    3. Enter my email in the field at the top
    4. Make sure the "Notify people" box is checked
    - Click "Send" in the bottom right

## [Feedback Tips]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Be specific and reasonable!
    - People can't change if they don't understand _exactly_ what you mean
    - Gigantic tasks can be demoralizing and counter-productive

\

. . .

- Pair critiques with positive comments
    - What someone did well can be _just as important_ as where they can improve!

\

. . . 

- Be <u>constructively</u> critical
    - Imagine what would fix the thing you didn't like then suggest that solution
