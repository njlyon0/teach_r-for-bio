### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Muddiest Point Review
- Statistics Background
- Stats Roadmap
- Fundamental Statistical Tests
- Multiple X Variables

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Recognize continuous versus categorical variables
- Identify which statistical test is appropriate given X/Y variable types
- Perform analytical tests using R

## [Muddiest Point Review]{.gold}

- Recurring topics from most recent MPs:

\

- Function Tutorial Assignment Questions

\

. . .

- What other topic(s) would you like to review?

## [Statistics Chat]{.gold} {.smaller}

- What previous experience do you have with statistics?
    - <u>Do not worry</u> if the answer is "none"!
    - I just want to get a sense for where you're at

\

. . .

- What terms come to mind when you think about stats?

\

. . .

- Have you heard of (or read about) any specific tests?
    - If so, what were they?

## [Statistics & Scientific Method]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Scientific Method:
    1. Ask a question
    2. Make a hypothesis (educated guess for answer to question)
    3. Test hypothesis with experiment
    4. Analyze data to test hypothesis
    5. Report results

\

. . .

- "Statistics" is what we do with our data to test our hypotheses!
    - I.e., whether we find support for our hypothesis or not

## [Statistics Justification Example]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Hypothesis: adding Nitrogen (N) to soil will make sunflowers grow taller

\

. . .

- Test: Grow many sunflowers either <u>with</u> or <u>without</u> adding a set amount of N to the soil

\

. . .

- Data: After set number of days, measure height of all sunflowers

. . .

![](images/sunflower-hypothesis.png){.absolute top=450 left=750 width="40%" fig-alt="cartoon of a small sunflower emoji labeled 'regular soil' and a larger sunflower emoji labeled '+N soil'"}

## [Stats Example Continued]{.orange} {.smaller}

- How do we decide whether adding N to the soil resulted in taller sunflowers?
    - What difference in height would be "enough" to say whether we were right?

\

. . .

- What if _some_ of the +N sunflowers are _shorter_ than some of the regular sunflowers?
    - Does this mean our hypothesis isn't supported?

\

. . .

- We need to use a statistical test to evaluate our hypothesis! 

## [Statistics' Role in Science]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Statistical tests let us know whether or not our hypothesis is supported
    - These tests include some assumptions but they are well-documented

\

. . . 

- Scientists assess the appropriateness of the statistics in _the same way they do_ for experimental design

\

. . .

- [A perfect experiment with inappropriate statistics is <u>not good science</u>]{.purple}

## [Data Science & Statistics]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Today is <u>**_not_**</u> a deep dive into the math behind statistics!
    - There are whole classes devoted to that

\

. . . 

- Professional data scientists have to look at data and pick an appropriate test

\

. . .

- In this class weâ€™ll:
    - 1. Look at some typical test types
    - 2. Cover what data types are the best fit for each test

## [Data Science & Statistics Analogy]{.orange}

- Statisticians are like artists
- Data scientists are like art historians

\

. . .

- Data scientists recognize art and can talk about it but we _may or may not_ be artists ourselves!

#### Null Hypothesis Testing

1. Make hypothesis & "null hypothesis"
    - H~A~: Something is happening
    - H~0~: Nothing is happening

2. Assess odds of obtaining results as extreme as observations _assuming H~0~ is correct_

\

#### Multi-Model Inference

1. Define many possible explanations for observation
    - I.e., many competing hypotheses

2. Compare model strength
    - Stronger models are better fit for the data and thus are more likely to be true

\

- More on this in [Lecture \#5]{.blue}!

## [Null Hypothesis: P Values]{.orange} {.smaller}

- P values < 0.05 are called [significant]{.purple}
    - Significant P values mean you 'reject the null hypothesis'
    - I.e., you find support for your hypothesis!

\

. . .

- 0.05 < p < 0.1 is 'marginally significant'
    - A.k.a. weak evidence of support for hypothesis

\

. . .

- In science writing, ["significant" **_always_** means P < 0.05]{.purple}
    - Use synonyms for non-P value contexts
    - E.g., dramatic, substantial, important, etc.

## [Hypothesis Testing Chat]{.gold}

- What questions do you have about this?

\

. . .

- Ready to continue?
    - I promise that is the end of the "stats theory" portion!

Continuous response with categorical explanatory is labeled 'ANOVA' while the opposite corner of the table is labeled 'generalized linear model'"}

:::

## [Regression]{.orange} {.smaller}

- X & Y are _both_ continuous

\

- Hypothesis: The slope of the line between X & Y is <u>not</u> flat
    - H~0~: The slope of the line _is_ flat

\

- Examples:
    - Butterfly toxicity (Y) increases with time (X)
    - Tree diameter (Y) increases with age (X)

## [Regression Visual]{.orange}

```{r regression}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of penguin bill depth against bill length"
#| fig-width: 7
#| panel: center

# Load in penguins dataset
peng_df <- palmerpenguins::penguins

# Make graph
ggplot(peng_df, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, fill = 'x')) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2.5, alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = F, color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#fb8500") +
  labs(x = "Bill Depth (mm)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  supportR::theme_lyon() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## [R Stats Syntax]{.orange} {.smaller}

- All R statistical test functions use the same syntax
    - Thankfully!

\

. . .

- Syntax is as follows:
```{.r}
# Test effect of otters on sea urchins
stat_test(urchin_count ~ otter_count, data = kelp_forest_df)
```

\

. . .

- Some tests require other arguments
    - But the above example is a template of the fundamental bits


## [Regression Syntax]{.orange} {.smaller}

- The function for regressions is `lm`
    - Short for "linear model"

\

. . .

- Example syntax:
```{.r}
# Run a regression
my_model <- lm(response ~ explanatory, data = my_df)
```

## [Practice: Regression]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="hex logo for palmerpenguins R package"}

- You are studying penguins and want to test the following hypotheses:
    - H~A~: As penguin bill length increases, bill depth decreases
    - H~0~: Bill length and bill depth have no relationship

\

. . . 

- Use a [regression]{.purple} to test the hypothesis and assign it to an object
    - What is the class of that object? What is its structure?

\

. . .

- Run the `summary` function on that object to get a human readable summary table

## [Interpreting Summary Tables]{.orange} {.smaller}

- You (maybe): "Okay, cute summary table but is our hypothesis supported or not?"

\
\
\

Y-intercept, explanatory variable, slope of line, test statistic, p value, p value asterisks, and p value asterisk codes are all separately indicated in the screen capture" width="100%">
</p>

## [<u>An</u>alysis <u>o</u>f <u>Va</u>riance (ANOVA)]{.orange} {.smaller}

- X is categorical _but_ Y is continuous

\

- Hypothesis: Groups of X have different average Y values
    - H~0~: All groups of X have the _same_ average Y values

\

- ANOVA function is `aov`

\

- Examples:
    - Different countries (X) have different numbers of rabbits (Y)
    - Grazing on pastures (X) reduces plant height (Y)

## [ANOVA Visual]{.orange}

```{r aov}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Bar plot of penguin flipper length against penguin species. Error bars are standard deviation"
#| fig-width: 7
#| panel: center

# Caculate average values within groups
peng_avgdf <- supportR::summary_table(data = penguins, groups = "species",
                                      response = "flipper_length_mm")

# Make graph
ggplot(peng_avgdf, aes(x = species, y = mean, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', color = 'black') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - std_dev, ymax = mean + std_dev),
                width = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#8ecae6", "#219ebc", "#023047")) +
  labs(x = "Penguin Species", y = "Average Flipper Length (mm)") +
  supportR::theme_lyon() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## [Practice: ANOVA]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%" fig-alt="hex logo for palmerpenguins R package"}

- You are still studying penguins but have new hypotheses:
    - H~A~: Penguin species have _different_ flipper lengths
    - H~0~: Penguin species _do not_ have different flipper lengths

\

. . . 

- Use an [ANOVA]{.purple} to test the hypothesis and assign it to an object
    - What is the class of that object? What is its structure?

\

. . .

- Use the `summary` function to see if your hypothesis was supported
    - What difference(s) do you see between this and the regression summary table?

## [Chi Squared Test]{.orange} {.smaller}

- X & Y _both_ categorical

\

- Hypothesis: Categories of X affect categories of Y
    - H~0~: Categories of X are not related to categories of Y

\

- Used in medical contexts and Hardy Weinberg Equillibrium
    - You may have encountered this in BIO 102

. . .

Categorical response with multiple continuous explanatory variables is still a generalized linear model. Continuous response with multiple categorical explanatory variables is an 'n-way ANOVA'." width="80%">
</p>

## [R Syntax for Multiple Xs]{.orange}

- Special syntax to indicate multiple explanatory variables
    - Separate each explanatory variable with a plus sign

\

. . .

- Example syntax:
```{.r}
# Test with two explanatory variables
stat_test(response_var ~ exp_var1 + exp_var2, data = my_df)
```

## [_n_-way ANOVA]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Multiple X variables and Y must be continuous
    - X variables may be either categorical or continuous 

\

. . . 

- "n" = number of X variables
    - E.g., 2-way ANOVA has 2 X variables

\

. . .

- Hypothesis: Each X variable (_separately_) affects Y values
    - H~0~: Each X does not affect Y

## [_n_-way ANOVA Continued]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Returns a P value for _each_ X variable

\

. . . 

- Examples:
    - Temperature (X) and bird presence (X) both affect worm length (Y)
    - Fire (X) and grazing (X) both affect butterfly lifespan (Y)

\

. . . 

- _n_-way ANOVA function is the same as the regular ANOVA -- `aov`
    - "Regular ANOVA" == 1-way ANOVA

## [Practice: 2-way ANOVA]{.pink} {.smaller}

![](images/hex-penguins.png){.absolute top=0 left=1100 width="12%"}

- New funding source and new hypothesis for your penguin research:
    - H~A~: Penguin body mass differs among species and among islands
    - H~0~: Penguin body mass _does not_ differ with penguin species or island

\

. . .

- Test H~A~ with a 2-way ANOVA
    - Was your hypothesis supported?
    - What difference(s) do you see between this and a 1-way ANOVA summary table?
