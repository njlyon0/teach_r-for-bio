## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Muddiest Point Review
- Statistics Background
- Stats Roadmap
- Fundamental Statistical Tests

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Recognize continuous versus categorical variables
- Identify which statistical test is appropriate given X/Y variable types
- Perform analytical tests using R

## [Muddiest Point Review]{.gold}

- Recurring topics from most recent MPs:

\

- Function Tutorial Assignment Questions

\

. . .

- What other topic(s) would you like to review?

## [Statistics Chat]{.gold} {.smaller}

- What previous experience do you have with statistics?
    - <u>Do not worry</u> if the answer is "none"!
    - I just want to get a sense for where you're at

\

. . .

- What terms come to mind when you think about stats?

\

. . .

- Have you heard of (or read about) any specific tests?
    - If so, what were they?

## [Statistics & Scientific Method]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Scientific Method:
    1. Ask a question
    2. Make a hypothesis (educated guess for answer to question)
    3. Test hypothesis with experiment
    4. Analyze data to test hypothesis
    5. Report results

\

. . .

- "Statistics" is what we do with our data to test our hypotheses!
    - I.e., whether we find support for our hypothesis or not

## [Statistics Justification Example]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Hypothesis: adding Nitrogen (N) to soil will make sunflowers grow taller

\

. . .

- Test: Grow many sunflowers either <u>with</u> or <u>without</u> adding a set amount of N to the soil

\

. . .

- Data: After set number of days, measure height of all sunflowers

. . .

![](images/sunflower-hypothesis.png){.absolute top=450 left=750 width="40%"}

## [Stats Example Continued]{.orange} {.smaller}

- How do we decide whether adding N to the soil resulted in taller sunflowers?
    - What difference in height would be "enough" to say whether we were right?

\

. . .

- What if _some_ of the +N sunflowers are _shorter_ than some of the regular sunflowers?
    - Does this mean our hypothesis isn't supported?

\

. . .

- We need to use a statistical test to evaluate our hypothesis! 

## [Statistics' Role in Science]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Statistical tests let us know whether or not our hypothesis is supported
    - These tests include some assumptions but they are well-documented

\

. . . 

- Scientists assess the appropriateness of the statistics in _the same way they do_ for experimental design

\

. . .

- A perfect experiment with inappropriate statistics is <u>not good science</u>

## [Data Science & Statistics]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Today is <u>**_not_**</u> a deep dive into the math behind statistics!
    - There are whole classes devoted to that

\

. . . 

- Professional data scientists have to look at data and pick an appropriate test

\

. . .

- In this class we’ll:
    - 1. Look at some typical test types
    - 2. Cover what data types are the best fit for each test

## [Data Science & Statistics Analogy]{.orange}

- Statisticians are like artists
- Data scientists are like art historians

\

. . .

- Data scientists recognize art and can talk about it but we _may or may not_ be artists ourselves!

## [Hypothesis Testing Philosophies]{.orange} {.smaller}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Null Hypothesis Testing

1. Make hypothesis & "null hypothesis"
    - H~A~: Something is happening
    - H~0~: Nothing is happening

2. Assess odds of obtaining results as extreme as observations _assuming H~0~ is correct_

\

- Measured by [P value]{.purple}
    - Ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%)

#### Multi-Model Inference

1. Define many possible explanations for observation
    - I.e., many competing hypotheses

2. Compare model strength
    - Stronger models are better fit for the data and thus are more likely to be true

\

- More on this in [Lecture \#5]{.blue}!

## [Philosophies Continued]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Null hypothesis testing & multi-model inference are <u>both</u> good science!
    - Just different framings of a hypothesis

::::{.columns}

- Does temperature have _more of an effect_ than rainfall on newt growth?

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

- Higher temperatures and more rainfall affect newt growth

## [Null Hypothesis: P Values]{.orange} {.smaller}

- P values < 0.05 are called "significant"
    - Significant P values mean you 'reject the null hypothesis'
    - I.e., you find support for your hypothesis!

\

. . .

- 0.05 < p < 0.1 is 'marginally significant'
    - A.k.a. weak evidence of support for hypothesis

\

. . .

- In science writing, "significant" **_always_** means P < 0.05
    - Use synonyms for non-P value contexts
    - E.g., dramatic, substantial, important, etc.

## [Hypothesis Testing Chat]{.gold}

- What questions do you have about this?

\

. . .

- Ready to continue?
    - I promise that is the end of the "stats theory" portion!
