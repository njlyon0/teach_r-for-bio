## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- R Markdown Files
- Loading Data
- Working with Data
- Tidyverse - `dplyr`

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Define the three major components of RMarkdown files (.Rmd)
- Write code to load external data into R
- Explore data with base R tools
- Manipulate data with `dplyr`

## [GitHub Individual Work]{.gold} {.smaller}

- Great work last week!

\

- In the next week or two (i.e., before the second half of the course) I would like you to:
    - Make _another_ practice repository (or maybe 2!)

\

- What questions do you have about this?
    - Does this feel reasonable to you?
