## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Core Content
    - Muddiest Point Review
    - Version Control Background
    - Navigating GitHub

\

- Time Permitting
    - Git / GitHub Setup
    - RStudio + Git / GitHub

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Explain the difference(s) between Git and GitHub
- Define fundamental version control vocabulary

\

### Time Permitting

- Integrate Git and GitHub with RStudio on your computer

## [Muddiest Point Review]{.gold}

- Recurring topics from most recent MPs:
    - TBD

\

. . .

- What other topic(s) would you like to review?

## [Version Control Background]{.orange}

- "Version control" is a set of tools for tracking changes to a code file

\

- Version control lets you work only in a single file but still preserves the history
    - No comments you'd have to resolve (like MS Word / etc.)
    - No need to "Save As" and retain many different files for each draft

## [Version Control Rationale]{.orange} {.smaller}

Why use version control?

\

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="33.33%"}

##### Collaboration `r fontawesome::fa(name = "handshake", a11y = "sem")`

\

Easily share & work together on files

:::

:::{.column width="33.33%"}

##### Reproducibility `r fontawesome::fa(name = "arrows-left-right", a11y = "sem")`

\

Fully document your progress and end results

::: 


:::{.column width="33.33%"}

##### Portfolio `r fontawesome::fa(name = "book", a11y = "sem")`

\

Demonstrate your skills to others with coding know-how

## [Git Versus GitHub]{.orange} {.smaller}

:::{.column width="50%"}

### Git

- Actual version control software

\

- Does the tracking of changes

\

- Works locally on your computer

\

- Not something others can interact with

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

### GitHub

- <u>G</u>raphical <u>u</u>ser <u>i</u>nterface (GUI) for Git

\

- Allows _viewing_ of Git-tracked changes
    - Not actually doing version control itself

\

- Other users can see your content
    - Depending on your settings

:::

## [Create a Github Profile]{.gold}

- On your computer, go to [github.com](https://github.com/)

\

- Create a profile

\

- Let me know if you run into any issues!

## [Navigating GitHub]{.orange} {.smaller}

- We'll work through part of an established GitHub workshop for this section

\

- [nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/github](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/github.html)

## [Practice: Create a Repository]{.pink} {.smaller}

- To practice what we've just covered, you all will make a practice repository!

\

. . .

- This is a test repository so:
    - Set it to "Private"
    - Create the repo with both a README and a .gitignore

\

. . .

- As you go through this process, take notes for 'future you'
    - This course will require you to make two more repositories 
    - So you'll want to have a good resource to remind yourself with down the line

## [Temperature Check]{.purple}

#### How are you Feeling?
