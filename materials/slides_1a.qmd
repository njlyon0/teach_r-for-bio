## [Data Science Definition]{.orange} 

\
\

Data science combines [_programming_]{.purple} and statistics with [_subject matter expertise_]{.purple} to identify patterns and insights hidden in data

## [Why is this Course Taught in R?]{.orange}

R is a programming language that is _awesome_ for environmental data scientists

\

. . .

Benefits of R:

| Free | Reproducible | Accessible | Popular | Versatile |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `r fontawesome::fa(name = "piggy-bank", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "repeat", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "universal-access", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "star", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "masks-theater", a11y = "sem")` |

## [R's Popularity]{.orange}

```{r popularity-ggplot}
#| echo: false

# Read in data
pop_df <- read.csv(file = file.path("materials", "data", "r-popularity.csv"))

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Make graph
ggplot(pop_df, aes(x = year, y = percent_papers)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = F, color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(fill = 'x'), size = 5, pch = 21) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Papers Using R (%)") +
  # Tweak X-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(pop_df$year)) +
  # Custom color
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#ffc300") +
  # Custom theming
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        # axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

### `r fontawesome::fa(name = "arrows-left-right", a11y = "sem")` Reproducibility 

- R is written in "[scripts]{.orange}"
    - Scripts = step-by-step instructions
- Scripts can be run by _any_ R user
- Allows perfect replication of process
- Programs that require clicking buttons are not (as) reproducible
    - Would depend on accompanying written/verbal instructions
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Collaboration  `r fontawesome::fa(name = "handshake", a11y = "sem")`

- R scripts can be co-developed!
- They can then be shared like a paper draft
- Many tools exist to formalize sharing
    - We'll cover one in this course!
- Unscripted programs would again require written/verbal instructions
    - Then hoping someone clicks the right buttons in the right way

## [Problem Solving Methods]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Problem solving is an important life skill generally
    - Also useful for data science!

\

. . .

- I _do not_ recommend using AI as a problem-solving method

\

. . .

- Let's discuss some useful strategies:
    1. 'Rubber duck' method
    2. Google (seriously!)
    3. Teamwork
    4. Take a break
    5. Whatever methods _you_ use!

## ["AI" Aside]{.gold} {.smaller}

- I _strongly_ discourage the use of AI tools in this class
    - E.g., ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, etc.

\

. . .

- Two primary reasons:
    1. It undermines your learning
    2. There is an ethical dimension we don't have time to cover in this class

\

. . .

- However, I'm an educator not a cop
    - I won't be policing you in order to enforce my take on AI

## [Method 1: Rubber Duck]{.orange} {.smaller}

![](images/ducky.png){.absolute top=50 left=800 width="20%" fig-alt="Image of a rubber duck"}
- Get rubber duck / small object

\

. . . 

- Explain each line of your code to the duck
    - Go into as much detail as possible
    - Re-read lines _carefully_ as you explain

\

. . .

- You'll catch typos/errors that you had missed!

\

. . .

- Why "rubber duck" instead of "friend"?
    - Because it would likely be a dull experience for your friend `r fontawesome::fa(name = "smile", a11y = "sem")`

## [Method 2: Google]{.orange} {.smaller}

![](images/logo-google.png){.absolute top=50 left=700 width="30%" fig-alt="Google logo"}

- This is a serious suggestion!
    - Google is truly an _amazing_ resource for this

\

. . . 

- There are forums where where people discuss code issues
    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/programming-help), etc.

\

. . . 

- If you get an error:
    1. Copy the entire error message
    2. Paste it into Google
    3. Check the first few links to see how others solved that issue

## [Google Tips]{.orange} {.smaller}

![](images/logo-google.png){.absolute top=50 left=700 width="30%" fig-alt="Google logo"}

- **Ignore** the "AI Overview"
    - This is frequently wrong and/or misleading
    - Click actual links!

\

. . . 

- Use a plus sign (`+`) between search terms
    - E.g., "R + \<error message text\>"

\

. . . 

- When specific wording matters, use quotes!
    - E.g., "I want results with _exactly_ this phrase"

## [Method 3: Team Up!]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Group work is a classic method of problem solving

\

. . . 

- Email/text classmates about errors you're encountering
    - Set up a weekly time to meet and work together

\

. . . 

- Group work & assignments
    - I really encourage you to work together to [solve problems]{.blue}
    - _BUT_ assignments should be produced by you alone
    - There are **no group assignments** in this course!

## [Method 4: Take a Break]{.orange}

<p align="center">
<img src="comics/need-a-min.png" alt="Creature saying they need a minute while the R logo with eyes looks worried in a cloud of error messages"/>
</p>

## [Method 4: Take a Break]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Coding issues can be super frustrating
   - Totally **normal** to feel this way

\

. . .

- If you are struggling to solve a problem, take a few minutes to step re-set
   - Physically step away and do something active
   - Do one of your hobbies for a few minutes
   - Work on something else

\

. . .

- Return to the problem an hour or so later and try again!

## [Method 5: Yours!]{.gold}

- As students, you're experienced problem solvers already!

\

. . . 

- Code problems can likely be solved by the strategies you already use!

\

. . . 

- How do you solve problems you encounter in other courses or at work?

</p>

## [Computer File Paths]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Computers store files in "[folders]{.orange}"
    - Folders can be _nested_ inside other folders

\

. . .

- The name of all folders leading to a particular file is that file's "[file path]{.purple}"
    - File path starts at the biggest folder ("top" folder) and ends at the file
    - Each folder name is separated by slashes (`\` or `/`)


\

. . .

- For example: _[\~]{.blue} [/]{.orange} Downloads [/]{.orange} BIO-316_syllabus.docx_

## [File Path Example]{.gold} {.smaller}

What is the file path for the **notes** document in this image?

<p align="center">
<img src="images/file-path.png" alt="Diagram of hierarchically nested folders with a 'downloads' folder and 'documents' folder at the top where 'documents' contains a 'bio 101' and 'bio 316' folder and the 'bio 316' folder contains a notes document" width = "50%">
</p>

. . . 

_[\~]{.blue} [/]{.orange} Documents [/]{.orange} BIO 316 [/]{.orange} BIO316-Notes-Week 1.docx_

## [Practice: File Paths]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Pick a file on your computer
    - _Not_ one in the "Downloads" folder (file paths are too short)

\

. . .

- What is that file's path?
    - Hint: _[\~]{.blue} [/]{.orange} ... [/]{.orange} ... [/]{.orange} ..._

\

. . .

- When you have it, show me the file and tell me its path
