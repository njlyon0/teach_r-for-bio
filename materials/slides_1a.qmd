## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Introductions
- Data Science Background
- Why R?
- Problem Solving Tips (for Coding)
- Computer File Paths

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Define "data science"
- Explain why the course is taught in R
- Identify useful code problem solving techniques
- Demonstrate comprehension of computer file paths

## [Introductions]{.gold}

Tell me a bit about yourselves!

. . .

- What is your preferred name?

- What year are you in school?

- What's a fun fact that brings you joy?

## [Introductions (Continued)]{.gold}

- Why did you sign up for the course?

- What skill(s) are you most excited to learn?

- What previous coding / data science experience do you have?
    - Absolutely fine if this is your first foray into data science!

## [My Goal for You]{.purple}

## [Data Science Definition]{.orange} 

Data science combines [_programming_]{.gold} and statistics with [_subject matter expertise_]{.purple} to identify patterns and insights hidden in data

## [Why is this Course Taught in R?]{.orange} {.smaller}

R is a programming language that is _awesome_ for environmental data scientists

Benefits of R:

## [R's Popularity]{.orange}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Read in data
pop_df <- read.csv(file = file.path("materials", "data", "r-popularity.csv"))

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Make graph
ggplot(pop_df, aes(x = year, y = percent_papers)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = F, color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(fill = 'x'), size = 5, pch = 21) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Papers Using R (%)") +
  # Tweak X-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(pop_df$year)) +
  # Custom color
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#ffc300") +
  # Custom theming
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        # axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

### `r fontawesome::fa(name = "arrows-left-right", a11y = "sem")` Reproducibility 

- R is written in "[scripts]{.blue}"
    - Scripts = step-by-step instructions
- Scripts can be run by _any_ R user
- Allows perfect replication of process
- Programs that require clicking buttons are not (as) reproducible
    - Would depend on accompanying written/verbal instructions
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Collaboration  `r fontawesome::fa(name = "handshake", a11y = "sem")`

- R scripts can be co-developed!
- They can then be shared like a paper draft
- Many tools exist to formalize sharing
    - We'll cover one in this course!
- Unscripted programs would again require written/verbal instructions
    - Then hoping they click the right buttons in the right way

## [Problem Solving Methods]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Problem solving is an important life skill generally
    - Also useful for data science!

\

- Let's discuss some useful strategies:
    1. 'Rubber duck' method
    2. Google (seriously!)
    3. Teamwork
    4. Take a break
    5. Whatever methods _you_ use!

## [Method 1: Rubber Duck]{.orange} {.smaller}

![](images/ducky.png){.absolute top=50 left=800 width="250" height="250"}
- Get rubber duck / small object

. . . 

- Explain each line of your code to the duck
    - Go into as much detail as possible
    - Re-read lines _carefully_ as you explain

. . .

- You'll catch typos/errors that you had missed!

. . .

- Why "rubber duck" instead of "friend"?
    - Because it would likely be a dull experience for your friend `r fontawesome::fa(name = "smile", a11y = "sem")`
