## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Introductions
- Data Science Background
- Why R?
- Problem Solving Tips (for Coding)
- Computer File Paths

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Define "data science"
- Explain why the course is taught in R
- Identify useful code problem solving techniques
- Demonstrate comprehension of computer file paths

## [Introductions]{.gold}

Tell me a bit about yourselves!

. . .

- What is your preferred name?

- What year are you in school?

- What's a fun fact that brings you joy?

## [Introductions (Continued)]{.gold}

- Why did you sign up for the course?

- What skill(s) are you most excited to learn?

- What previous coding / data science experience do you have?
    - Absolutely fine if this is your first foray into data science!

## [Data Science Definition]{.orange} 

Data science combines [_programming_]{.gold} and statistics with [_subject matter expertise_]{.purple} to identify patterns and insights hidden in data

## Why is this Course Taught in R? {.smaller}

`r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#F4F3EE", a11y = "sem")` is a programming language that is _awesome_ for environmental data scientists

\

. . .

Benefits of R:

. . .

- Free!
- Reproducible
- Accessible
    - _Many_ online tutorials for R
- Popular
- Versatile

## [R's Popularity]{.orange}

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Read in data
pop_df <- read.csv(file = file.path("materials", "data", "r-popularity.csv"))

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Make graph
ggplot(pop_df, aes(x = year, y = percent_papers)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = F, color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(fill = 'x'), size = 5, pch = 21) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Papers Using R (%)") +
  # Tweak X-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(pop_df$year)) +
  # Custom color
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#ffc300") +
  # Custom theming
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        # axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

### `r fontawesome::fa(name = "arrows-left-right", fill = "#F4F3EE", a11y = "sem")` Reproducibility 

- R is written in "[scripts]{.blue}"
    - Scripts = step-by-step instructions
- Scripts can be run by _any_ R user
- Allows perfect replication of process
- Programs that require clicking buttons are not (as) reproducible
    - Would depend on accompanying written/verbal instructions
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Collaboration  `r fontawesome::fa(name = "handshake", fill = "#F4F3EE", a11y = "sem")`

- R scripts can be co-developed!
- They can then be shared like a paper draft
- Many tools exist to formalize sharing
    - We'll cover one in this course!
- Unscripted programs would again require written/verbal instructions
    - Then hoping they click the right buttons in the right way
