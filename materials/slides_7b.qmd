    - Even more confidently!


## [Muddiest Point Review]{.gold}

\

. . .

- What other topic(s) would you like to review?

## [Create a Google Form]{.pink} {.smaller}

\

. . .

- Make a new Google Form for peer feedback today
    - Remember to add me to the editing side!

\

. . .

- Your form should have (at least):
    - Question about whether people feel you addressed their feedback from [Draft 1]{.blue}
    - Any questions from first survey that you think are still valuable

## [Revised Function Tutorials]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Something to keep in mind:
    - There is an <u>optional</u> 3^rd^ draft! 
    - If you submit draft 3 and do better than draft 2, [it will replace your score]{.purple}
    - So take feedback seriously just in case you're unhappy with your draft 2 points!

- Anyone want to volunteer to go first?
    - I'll pick order randomly if there are no volunteers
