## [Function Tutorial Assignment]{.orange}

- Picking functions today!

\

- Take a moment and get your 7-10 functions list ready
    - You may also want to pull up CRAN (just in case)

\

- Any lingering questions about this assignment?
    - Esp. any that need to be answered _before_ picking functions

## [Randomizing Vectors]{.orange} {.smaller}

- We'll use `sample` to randomize student order

\

- `sample` has three main arguments:
    - `x` = vector to randomize
    - `size` = number of times to randomly sample
    - `replace` = whether vector elements can be retrieved more than once

\

. . .

- In our case:
    - `x` = vector of student names
    - `size` = number of students
    - `replace` = `FALSE` (don't want to double pick the same student)

## [Randomizing Vectors Demo]{.orange}

- Let's look at an example to clarify that

```{.r code-line-numbers="|2|5"}
# Make a vector of faux students
students <- c("albatross", "cactus", "wave")

# Randomize a vector
sample(x = students, size = 3, replace = FALSE)
```

## [Function Tutorial: Pick Functions]{.gold} {.smaller}

- Using order from `sample` we’ll claim one function each per round:
    - Round 1: random order
    - Round 2: reverse of Round 1 order
    - Round 3: new random order

\

. . .

- Claimed functions should be entered in the Google Sheet I made for this

\

. . .

- We’ll go one by one so <u>do not enter functions</u> before your turn!

## [Function Tutorial: Free Work]{.pink} {.smaller}

- Make a new R Markdown file for this assignment

\

- Write in your three functions and which package(s) they come from

\

- Remember to check their help file!
    - `?function_name`

\

- The help file also (sometimes) has examples at the bottom!
    - Feel free to **_adapt_** these for your tutorial assignment `r fontawesome::fa("smile", a11y = "sem")`
