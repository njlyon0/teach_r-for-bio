## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Installation Check (R + RStudio)
- Navigating RStudio
- RStudio Projects
- R Scripts
- "Base" R

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Set up RStudio on your computer
- Create an RStudio Project
- Use R Scripts
- Define fundamental base R terms
    - E.g., object, assign, function, arguments, etc.
- Solve simple arithmetic operations using R

## [Installation Check: R & RStudio]{.gold}

:::{.incremental}

- Did anyone <u>_not_</u> get [R]{.blue} installed?

\

- Did anyone <u>_not_</u> get [RStudio]{.orange} installed?

\

- Once you have both installed, please open [RStudio]{.orange}

## [R versus RStudio]{.orange} {.smaller}

:::{.column width="50%"}

\
\

- Access to fundamental R operations
- Not aesthetically pleasing
    - In my opinion `r fontawesome::fa(name = "smile", a11y = "sem")`
- Faster for _very_ complex operations
    - Unlikely to matter for this course!

![](images/logo-rstudio.png){.absolute top=100 left=580 width="35%"}
\
\
\
\

- Access to fundamental R operations
- Allows custom aesthetics
- Has quality-of-life improvements
- Technically an "[IDE]{.purple}"
    - <u>I</u>ntegrated <u>D</u>eveloper <u>E</u>nvironment

## [RStudio Layout]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Layout consisting of four [panes]{.blue}
    - Each pane has [tabs]{.gold} that do different things
    - You can customize which tabs are in each pane!
- To customize options:
    - In top menu, click "Tools"
    - Select "Global Options"
    - Select "Pane Layout"
- I recommend the following layout:

![](images/rstudio-layout.png){.absolute top=280 left=600 width="40%"}

## [Practice: Choose Your Colors]{.pink}

- Tools `r fontawesome::fa("arrow-right", a11y = "sem")` Global Options `r fontawesome::fa("arrow-right", a11y = "sem")` Appearance 

- Look through some of the available color schemes

- Feel free to share the name of your favorites!

\

. . . 

- Once you've picked one that you're happy with:
    - Click "OK" (in bottom left)

## [RStudio Projects]{.orange}

:::{.incremental}

- Projects are a special way of marking a folder on your computer for R

\

- You can still use the folder for other stuff though!

\

- RStudio will give you benefits if you use Projects

:::

## [Why Use Projects?]{.orange} {.smaller}

- Sets default location for reading in / saving files
    - A.k.a. "importing" and "exporting" files

\

. . .

- Convenient separation among tasks you're working on!
    - RStudio 'remembers' which files are a part of each Project
    - Even re-opens whatever files you had opened last time you used the Project!

\

. . .

- Lowers risk of mixing up data / script files

## [Practice: Create a Project]{.pink} {.smaller}

1. Make an empty folder on your computer to make the Project in

\

2. In RStudio, click "Project: (None)" in the top right corner
    - Choose "New Project..."
    - Pick "Existing Directory"
    - Click "Browse..." and find the folder you made in [step 1]{.pink}

\

3. If the name of the folder you made in [step 1]{.pink} shows up in the top right corner of RStudio, it worked!
