## A Guide to Your Process

### [Scheduling]{.blue}

### [Learning Objectives]{.purple}

### [Practice]{.pink}

### [Supporting Information]{.orange}

### [Class Discussion]{.gold}

## [Today's Plan]{.blue}

- Installation Check (R + RStudio)
- Navigating RStudio
- RStudio Projects
- R Scripts
- "Base" R

## [Today's Learning Objectives]{.purple}

After today's session you will be able to:

. . .

- Set up RStudio on your computer
- Create an RStudio Project
- Use R Scripts
- Define fundamental base R terms
    - E.g., object, assign, function, arguments, etc.
- Solve simple arithmetic operations using R

## [Installation Check: R & RStudio]{.gold}

:::{.incremental}

- Did anyone <u>_not_</u> get [R]{.blue} installed?

\

- Did anyone <u>_not_</u> get [RStudio]{.orange} installed?

\

- Once you have both installed, please open [RStudio]{.orange}

- Access to fundamental R operations
- Not aesthetically pleasing
    - In my opinion `r fontawesome::fa(name = "smile", a11y = "sem")`
- Faster for _very_ complex operations
    - Unlikely to matter for this course!

- Access to fundamental R operations
- Allows custom aesthetics
- Has quality-of-life improvements
- Technically an "[IDE]{.purple}"
    - <u>I</u>ntegrated <u>D</u>eveloper <u>E</u>nvironment
