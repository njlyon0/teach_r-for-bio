    "text": "Homework 6\n\nLearning Objective(s)\nUpon completion of this assignment, students will be able to:\n\nCreate publication-quality graphs using the ggplot2 package\nCustomize background theme elements of those graphs\nMake multi-panel graphs both using ggplot2 and using the cowplot package\n\n\n\nAssignment Due Date(s)\nEach homework is due at midnight the day before each lecture (i.e., Monday night) Late work will be accepted but will be subject to the late assignments policy outlined in this course’s syllabus.\n\n\nAssignment Description\nThis homework should be submitted as an R Markdown with your last name and the week number as the file name (e.g., “Lyon_week6.Rmd”). Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nRecalling your exciting statistical discoveries on penguin flipper length relationship to sex, species, and island, you decide to make some publication quality figures to demonstrate your findings. Use the ggplot2 package to make the graphs and the palmerpenguins package for the “penguins” data.\n\nBegin by creating a violin plot with sex on the x axis and flipper length on the y axis. The violin blobs’ fill color should differ between the two sexes (default colors are fine!).\nThat graph was a fine first pass but you realize you’ve neglected to include penguin species information in the graph! Facet the graph to divide the plot into three panels (either rows or columns are fine)–one panel per species of penguin. Also, remove the gray background color (but keep the black axis lines!) and add custom axis titles that remove the underscores (“_“) in the raw column names.\n\nRemembering your colleague’s suggestion of evaluating the effect of island you decide to make a second graph where you visualize penguin flipper length at the three islands.\n\nCreate a violin plot where island is on the y axis and flipper length is on the x axis. Make the fill color of each violin different between islands. Remove the gray background color, keep black axis lines, and customize the axis titles so this graph visually matches your first graph.\nAfter making this graph you realize you are accidentally re-using the default ggplot2 red and blue colors. This could be very confusing to your audience so you definitely need to address it. Visit the Coolors website (coolors.co/palettes/trending) and pick a custom color for each of the three islands. Manually set the violin fill to give each island one of these three colors.\n\nYour two graphs are looking great! Now you just need to combine them into one file for ease of sharing to your peers. Use the cowplot package to put both graphs (the species by sex graph and the island graph) into one plot. These can be either side-by-side or one on top of the other depending on your preference.",

    "text": "Homework 3\n\nLearning Objective(s)\nUpon completion of this assignment, students will be able to:\n\nExplain fundamental aspects of R Markdown files\nUse data wrangling functions from the dplyr and tidyr packages\nRearrange wrangling code using the pipe operator (%&gt;%)\n\n\n\nAssignment Due Date(s)\nEach homework is due at midnight the day before each lecture (i.e., Monday night) Late work will be accepted but will be subject to the late assignments policy outlined in this course’s syllabus.\n\n\nAssignment Description\nThis homework should be submitted as an R markdown with your last name and the week number as the file name (e.g., “Lyon_week3.Rmd”). Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nIn your own words, explain the purpose of the YAML of an R Markdown file. What does it do / what is it for?\nImagine you’re working on an R Markdown file. You set one code chunk to include = FALSE. What will happen to the contents of that code chunk when you knit the file? What parts–if any–of the code chunk will be displayed in the knit file?\nYou are studying native bee populations and need to wrangle your dataset to be ready for someone else to take on analysis. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the dplyr and magrittr packages and read in the example bee data (“bees.csv”) into R and check its structure. How many rows / columns are there?\nYour advisor reminds you that 2021 was a tough year for field research and those data are likely not reliable. Use the filter function to remove all data on bees identified in 2021.\nYou also realize that your methods are not well-suited to capturing kleptoparasitic bee abundance so those values are not reliable enough to pass on to analysis. Use the select function to remove this column from the subset you just created.\nYou feel that the data you have now are clean enough to continue. However, your collaborator wants a column for the total bee abundance in each year. Use the mutate function to create the column your collaborator has requested from the data version created by the above step.\nYour collaborator loves the final data product you created! But they looked at your code and they think it can be streamlined. Copy the code you just wrote (filter, select, and mutate) and use the pipe operator (%&gt;%) to write a version that does all three steps without creating intermediary objects. Check the structure of the final object.\n\nYour data wrangling skills are so impressive to your collaborator that they ask for your help with a lichen project they have been working on. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the tidyr package and read in the example lichen data (“tree_lichen.csv”) into R and check its structure? What columns are included?\nYour collaborator tells you that they have already cleaned the data but the data shape isn’t exactly what they need. They want your help reshaping the data into long format. Use the pivot_longer function to reshape their data so that they have the following three columns: “tree” unchanged from the wide format version; “lichen_type” which includes whether the lichen is crustose, foliose, or fruticose; “percent_cover” which includes the percent cover values your collaborator measured in the field.\nCheck the structure of the long format object you created. How many rows are there?",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nA friend asks for your help wrangling some data for a summer project they did on tomatoes. Your friend tells you the “tomato.csv” file includes data on the number of buds, flowers, and fruits from 10 tomato plants they measured in a greenhouse. These plants either received no treatment or had Nitrogen added to their soil. Treatment information is listed in “tomato_treatment.csv”. Finally, some plants had some issues that your friend recorded in a third file just in case they needed to account for that in the statistics later on. This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the dplyr package and read in the three data files they shared with you: (1) “tomato.csv”, “tomato_treatment.csv”, and “tomato_issues.csv”. Check the structure of all three files.\nYour friend first wants you to attach the treatment information to the main data file. Do this with a join (by plant) so that no rows are lost and check the structure of the resulting object.\nYour friend has decided they do want to drop some of the plants that had issues after all. They want to remove the problem plants if they had either herbivore damage or a fungal infection (they are okay including over-watered plants in the final data). Using filter and an appropriate join of your choice, remove the plants your friend wants excluded from the data object you created in the previous part of this question. Check the structure of this object.\n\nLet’s revisit the penguin data from the palmerpenguins package to practice some statistics! This question has multiple parts, be sure to answer all components! Each sub-question should be in its own code chunk.\n\nLoad the palmerpenguins package and check the structure of the penguins data object.\nFor all columns, identify whether each column is “discrete” (aka “categorical”) or “continuous”.\nNow that you’ve identified the data type of each column, let’s do some statistics! Your hypothesis is that flipper length differs between male and female penguins. Fit the correct test and run summary on the model fit object. Was your hypothesis supported? How do you know? (Remember you can check the “roadmap” we covered in class!)\nYou hypothesize that penguins with a higher body mass have longer flippers. Fit the correct test and run summary on the model fit object. Was your hypothesis supported? How do you know?",

Note that last week you converted F to C and this week is the opposite!\n\nIn a code chunk, convert 22°C into Fahrenheit. Feel free to Google the formula. Also, note that you may want to be careful to use parentheses to make sure the order of operations is correct.\nIdentify which part of that formula should be replaced with an object (i.e., what part of the formula will become an argument).

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nAt an international conference you meet a French colleague also interested in penguin research. They’re very excited after your recent string of findings (and beautiful graphs) and want to plan a visit to the states to visit several researchers in your field. However, they intuitively think in Celsius (C) and would love your help with an R script that converts Fahrenheit (F) to their preferred temperature units\n\nCreate an object containing the number 35. Using that object, convert it to Celsius and print that converted value. The conversion formula is as follows: C = (F - 32) x 5/9\nYour colleague is very appreciative of your quick calculation but realizes it might be easier to convert a set of temperatures from C to F so that they can keep that range in mind. Write a for loop that converts 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95°F into their equivalents in C and prints the result\nYou’re happy with this loop but you don’t think the raw temperatures are going to be very useful to your colleague’s planning. Add a conditional to the loop where if the temperature in Celsius is less than or equal to 18 a message is printed that includes (1) the temp in Fahrenheit and (2) a note to your colleague that they should plan on packing a jacket. If the temperature is greater than 18°C, the message should still include the temp in F and can tell them not to worry about bringing a jacket\nWhether or not to bring a jacket is a rather coarse assessment of temperature though! Add more conditionals such that (A) if temperature is less than 18°C the message includes the note about bringing a jacket, (B) if temperature is greater than or equal to 23°C the message is that they should pack shorts, or (C) if temperature is between 18 and 23°C that neither shorts nor a jacket is required. All three message options should also include the temperature in Fahrenheit for that iteration of the loop (same as question 1c)",

Each muddiest point assignment should be relatively short, and all iterations of this assignment share the guidelines and rubric outlined in this document.\nEach muddiest point must address the following three questions:\n\nWhat topic covered in the last lecture/lab really “clicked” for you? What other concepts do you mentally connect that topic with?\nWhat topic covered in the last lecture/lab did you struggle to understand? What about the concept made it difficult for you to grasp?\nWhat questions do you have about the concept you struggled with that—if answered—would help clarify things for you?\n\nAll three questions must be answered, and each response should be sufficiently detailed for me to understand where you’re feeling confident versus what topics we may need to carve out extra in-class time to cover.\nRemember: there are no dumb questions! If you struggled with a topic, the odds are good that at least one other person struggled with the same thing. Asking instructors to re-cover materials can be an act of bravery and those of your peers struggling with the same question(s) will be appreciative that you brought it up!",

    "text": "Computer literacy is increasingly critical to all aspects of the world in which we live. Data science is the branch of this skillset that sits in the middle of the Venn diagram between computers and some other subject area. Regardless of your academic specialty, fundamental data science skills data are both extremely useful and highly sought after in virtually all career paths. This course aims to give you a primer on data management best practices, analytical processes, and reproducible code. There will also be an opportunity to practice communication of technical concepts to a non-specialist audience.\nThis course is relatively new so I will really appreciate your feedback and participation as we learn together! As such, I may need to adjust the scheduling of various topics (see the schedule for more information), but you will be notified of any changes sufficiently far in advance that you can prepare.\nI would also like to acknowledge that this course has taken place on Wôpanâak (Wampanoag), Massa-adchu-es-et (Massachusett), and Pokanoket land. For more information, please visit www.native-land.ca\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the principles of well-structured data and reproducible coding\nWrite short computer programs (called “scripts”) in R\nExplore data through wrangling and visualization techniques\nAutomate data processes using loops and conditionals\nApply general data science concepts to new datasets\nCreate a professional online presence on GitHub (www.github.com)\nEvaluate peer’s work and offer both useful positive and constructively critical feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Type\nDuration\n\n\n\n\nLecture\n1 hr 15 min\n\n\nLab\n2 hrs 20 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR (www.cran.r-project.org)\n\nI recognize that this website is very bare bones, but this program is the industry standard and enjoys the support of a large and active population of users. When you are troubleshooting (i.e., “debugging”) your code you will very much appreciate the breadth of people who are also using R. Follow the “Download R for …” link for your computer operating system (i.e., Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux) to install R.\n\nRStudio Desktop (www.posit.co/downloads)\n\nRStudio is the preferred platform for working in R; as the R website showed, so-called “base R” can be a little basic. RStudio will provide several helpful bells and whistles that will make the program easier to work with and easier on the eyes!\n\nGit & GitHub\n\nGit (an application like R) and GitHub (a website) will be a part of the course, but you do not need to do anything with them before we cover them in class! Installing Git can be a little annoying for those without command line (a.k.a. “terminal”, “shell”, or “bash”) experience. We’ll cover working with Git and GitHub together a few weeks into the course. If you feel so moved, you are welcome to try to install Git (see instructions here) and make a profile on GitHub on your own, but doing it alone is optional so don’t worry if you can’t get it to work before we cover it in class!\n\nMiscellaneous peer-reviewed articles / book excerpts\n\nI will provide any readings for the course in PDF format, so check the Canvas/etc. page regularly to download the necessary files. Any required readings will be posted at least one week before we discuss it in class. I’ll also do my best to link directly to the readings from this website!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get sick, observe a religious holiday unaccounted for by the university’s calendar, have to miss class for a job/grad school interview, or simply don’t think you can handle class on a given day, please email me as early as possible to let me know you won’t be in class with a (brief) explanation. This will help me to share resources we’ll cover in class with you and plan for a smaller in-class community while you are out. My hope is that this class will be somewhere you want to attend, but I understand that sometimes life happens!\nWhile attendance is neither required nor graded, please do not abuse my sympathy and instead reserve absences for days where you honestly cannot attend. Your presence in and contributions to class are important both to your understanding of the material and the creation and maintenance of an in-class community.\n\n\n\nLate work will be accepted with a 10% penalty for each day that it is late. You are welcome to submit assignments that are more than 10 days for feedback so that you can improve going forward but assignments submitted that far after the due date will not be worth any points. If you think that you will struggle to meet a particular deadline, come chat with me as soon as possible so that we can work out whether a compromise would be possible.\n\n\n\nIf needed, the entirety of this course can be taught virtually so I would like to clarify some expectations I have for that modality. I do not require that you either have your camera on or unmute yourself to contribute verbally. That said, talking with a room full of muted Zoom panels with cameras turned off makes it difficult for me to know whether I’m successfully engaging you and that you understand the material. Therefore, I really encourage you to have your cameras on and unmute to ask or answer questions as needed.\nRegardless of whether you take me up on that, I will make extensive use of the chat and “reactions” feature (i.e., thumbs up, raised hand, etc.) so be ready to engage on those axes whether or not your camera and mic are on for full participation credit (see participation guidelines below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPoint Value\nPercent of Total\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Homework\n80 pts (10 pts ea.)\n32% (4% ea.)\n\n\nMuddiest Point Responses\n40 pts (5 pts ea.)\n16% (2% ea.)\n\n\nR Function Tutorial - First Draft\n30 pts\n12%\n\n\nR Function Tutorial - Final Draft\n40 pts\n16%\n\n\nGitHub Presence\n40 pts\n16%\n\n\nParticipation (incl. R Package Report Peer Review)\n20 pts\n8%\n\n\n\nDetailed rubrics are shared elsewhere in this site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be eight (8) equally weighted homework assignments. These will be graded as follows:\n\n(10 pts) Produces the correct result using the requested approach\n(9 pts) Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect final product\n(5 pts) Attempts to accomplish the task and makes some progress using the core concept(s)\n(1 pt) Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept\n(0 pts) No submission OR submission is more than 10 days late\n\nHomework numbers 1 through 7 will be assigned after lecture and due before the following lecture at midnight (i.e., 7 days)\n\nHomework 8 will be assigned after lecture and due before lab of that week (i.e., 3 days) because there won’t be a lecture after that one\n\nI will give you feedback on these assignments that you are welcome to implement so that you can include those revised homework assignments in your GitHub portfolio (see “GitHub Presence” below)\n\n\n\n\n\n“Muddiest Point” is a type of exit ticket. Such assignments are meant to allow you space to think critically about what concepts from that day you felt confident with and which you struggled with (i.e., which were “muddier”).\nNote that if everything was clear in a given lesson then substituting a follow-up question that goes beyond the lecture materials is appropriate!\nThere will be eight (8) equally weighted muddiest point responses. These will be graded as follows:\n\n(5 pts) Clearly articulates both a concept that was difficult and what about that concept was challenging and a concept that was clear\n(3 pts) Identifies a difficult concept but does not explain what was challenging about it in sufficient detail that I can identify the stumbling block\n(1 pt) Response lacks depth and does not sufficiently explain why topic was difficult\n(0 pts) No submission OR submission is more than 10 days late\n\nAll muddiest point responses will be due by midnight the day before each lab (i.e., one day after the lecture to which they are responding)\n\nMy hope is this will be helpful to you in clearly remembering which topics did or did not make sense to you.\nAdditionally, this tight turn around will let me re-cover concepts in lab that several students identify as their muddiest point from that week’s lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full rubric is available elsewhere so that you can have some specific guidelines on how to succeed on this assignment\nFirst Draft\n\nStudents will pick three functions from R package(s) available on CRAN (i.e., “official” R packages)\nYou will then create a tutorial of these three functions aimed at an interested but non-specialist audience (i.e., your classmates) in an R Markdown file\nThis tutorial should be self-contained and support copy/pasting of code that runs for your classmates / me\nYou may begin work on this assignment whenever you wish though you may wish to wait until we cover R Markdown files in the early weeks of the course\nRoughly halfway through the course, you will share your R Markdowns with your classmates and walk us through your tutorial\nYour classmates will provide positive and constructively critical feedback on your tutorial\n\nRevision\n\nYou will have two weeks to implement any changes your classmates suggest by emphasizing strengths and addressing weaknesses indicated by your peers\nYou will then get to present your revised tutorial and receive more feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rubric for this assignment is also available elsewhere but the summarized description below may prove helpful in setting expectations.\nThis assignment includes two parts: (1) a fleshed-out GitHub profile including a ‘special repository’ that serves as a landing page for visitors to your profile and (2) a portfolio repository that includes (at least) your revised R Package Report\n\nDon’t worry if some of those vocabulary terms are alien to your right now, we will cover them in class/lab, and you will be well-prepared to tackle this component\nYour portfolio repository should also include any homework assignments that you receive a 9 or 10 on (or revise following a score)\n\nThis assignment is meant both to give you some working knowledge of Git/GitHub and to serve as a tangible resource that you can share with prospective employers and add to your resume and/or curriculum vitae (CV)\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that not everyone is equally comfortable speaking in front of a group, communication is still a crucial skill in virtually any career path. I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this course to get out of your comfort zone and try to develop that skill while in a safe environment if it is not your natural inclination. That being said, your participation grade will not be entirely dependent upon contributing to conversation and there will be other ways to grow as a communicator in this course.\n\nYour participation score includes:\n\nAsking questions in class (both verbally and in the Zoom chat)\nUseful written feedback to peers on either draft of their R package reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am committed to being a partner in your success in this course, and in the spirit of that I have the following tips for success:\n\nCome to office hours / email me\n\nI will be readily available via office hours and informally whenever my office door is open\nI am also happy to just chat with you about fun course-adjacent things, so don’t feel like you need to be struggling with the course to stop by\n\nCheck the Canvas page and your university email regularly\n\nMessages to the class/assignments/grades will be posted there\nCheck every so often so that no assignments / deadlines sneak up on you\n\nBuild “muscle memory”\n\nI will do my utmost to make this course accessible and fun, but programming is fundamentally a new language, so you’ll need to practice to “speak” it confidently\nI recommend playing with the concepts and code from class outside of class so that you can build fluency that will last beyond the scope of this course\nTry to convince a peer to let you teach them some topic we covered in class; teaching something is one of the best ways to truly understand that topic!\n\nGive me feedback on where I can improve/change my teaching style to benefit you\n\nI will give an anonymous mid-term evaluation so that I can be most effective for what you need to excel\nI will also welcome informal feedback if you are comfortable sharing\n\n\n\n\n\nI am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so that we can determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made or if an accommodation might be needed to overcome the limitations of the design. I am always happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. I welcome feedback that will assist me in improving the usability and experience for all students.\n\n\n\nThe university will provide me with each student’s legal name, but I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name. I will also use whichever gender pronouns you identify with. Please advise me of your pronouns and/or chosen name early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.\n\n\n\nGroup work is a significant part of this course explicitly in some of the assignments as well as implicitly by the collaborative nature of some of these coding tasks. I expect that you will be mutually respectful with one another both in and outside of class time. I will ask you questions during lab and lecture and both places are also an ideal time for you all to ask me questions that you have on course topics & policies. I don’t believe that “dumb questions” exist, and I expect that you treat your peers’ questions with the respect that your fellow students deserve. Together we will learn more in an environment where we build one another up than we would in one where we fail to support one another.",

    "text": "R (www.cran.r-project.org)\n\nI recognize that this website is very bare bones, but this program is the industry standard and enjoys the support of a large and active population of users. When you are troubleshooting (i.e., “debugging”) your code you will very much appreciate the breadth of people who are also using R. Follow the “Download R for …” link for your computer operating system (i.e., Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux) to install R.\n\nRStudio Desktop (www.posit.co/downloads)\n\nRStudio is the preferred platform for working in R; as the R website showed, so-called “base R” can be a little basic. RStudio will provide several helpful bells and whistles that will make the program easier to work with and easier on the eyes!\n\nGit & GitHub\n\nGit (an application like R) and GitHub (a website) will be a part of the course, but you do not need to do anything with them before we cover them in class! Installing Git can be a little annoying for those without command line (a.k.a. “terminal”, “shell”, or “bash”) experience. We’ll cover working with Git and GitHub together a few weeks into the course. If you feel so moved, you are welcome to try to install Git (see instructions here) and make a profile on GitHub on your own, but doing it alone is optional so don’t worry if you can’t get it to work before we cover it in class!\n\nMiscellaneous peer-reviewed articles / book excerpts\n\nI will provide any readings for the course in PDF format, so check the Canvas/etc. page regularly to download the necessary files. Any required readings will be posted at least one week before we discuss it in class. I’ll also do my best to link directly to the readings from this website!",

This will help me to share resources we’ll cover in class with you and plan for a smaller in-class community while you are out. My hope is that this class will be somewhere you want to attend, but I understand that sometimes life happens!\nWhile attendance is neither required nor graded, please do not abuse my sympathy and instead reserve absences for days where you honestly cannot attend. Your presence in and contributions to class are important both to your understanding of the material and the creation and maintenance of an in-class community.\n\n\n\nLate work will be accepted with a 10% penalty for each day that it is late. You are welcome to submit assignments that are more than 10 days for feedback so that you can improve going forward but assignments submitted that far after the due date will not be worth any points. If you think that you will struggle to meet a particular deadline, come chat with me as soon as possible so that we can work out whether a compromise would be possible.\n\n\n\nIf needed, the entirety of this course can be taught virtually so I would like to clarify some expectations I have for that modality. I do not require that you either have your camera on or unmute yourself to contribute verbally. That said, talking with a room full of muted Zoom panels with cameras turned off makes it difficult for me to know whether I’m successfully engaging you and that you understand the material. Therefore, I really encourage you to have your cameras on and unmute to ask or answer questions as needed.\nRegardless of whether you take me up on that, I will make extensive use of the chat and “reactions” feature (i.e., thumbs up, raised hand, etc.) so be ready to engage on those axes whether or not your camera and mic are on for full participation credit (see participation guidelines below).",

I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this course to get out of your comfort zone and try to develop that skill while in a safe environment if it is not your natural inclination. That being said, your participation grade will not be entirely dependent upon contributing to conversation and there will be other ways to grow as a communicator in this course.\n\nYour participation score includes:\n\nAsking questions in class (both verbally and in the Zoom chat)\nUseful written feedback to peers on either draft of their R package reports",

Remember to specifically load any necessary packages using the library function and include comments explaining what line(s) correspond to each of the following prompts.\n\nAs a comment, explain what steps are needed to install a new R package from CRAN and then use functions in that package\nAs a comment, explain (A) what is meant by “namespacing” a function and (B) what–in your opinion–the advantage(s) of namespacing are\nAs a comment, define what is meant by an object’s “class”\nAssign the base R constant letters to an object called “my_vec”. Using bracket notation and concatenation, subsample ‘my_vec’ to spell out your surname (i.e., your last name)\nThis is a multi-part question. Please be sure to answer every part of this question and include a comment above each answer explaining (briefly) what the line of code is doing in your own words\n\nLoad the palmerpenguins library\nAssign the “penguins_raw” dataframe embedded in that library to an object called “peng_df2”\nCheck the structure of ‘peng_df2’. How many rows are there? How many columns are there? As a comment, specify how you figured out the number of rows / columns\nSubset ‘peng_df2’ to only penguins that were found on the island named “Torgersen”. How many rows are in that subset (i.e., how many penguins were found on Torgersen Island)?\nUsing as many subsets as needed, identify how many penguins had their sex recorded. I.e., for how many rows of ‘peng_df2’ was the “Sex” column either “MALE” or “FEMALE”? As a comment, explain your thought process for how you figured this out.\n\nAs a comment, define what a “pull” means in the context of Git / GitHub\nAs a comment, provide the link to your GitHub profile (e.g., “github.com/njlyon0”)",
