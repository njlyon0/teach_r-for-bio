What about the concept made it difficult for you to grasp?\nWhat questions do you have about the concept you struggled with that—if answered—would help clarify things for you?\n\nAll three questions must be answered, and each response should be sufficiently detailed for me to understand where you’re feeling confident versus what topics we may need to carve out extra in-class time to cover.\nRemember: there are no dumb questions! If you struggled with a topic, the odds are good that at least one other person struggled with the same thing.

Data science is the branch of this skillset that sits in the middle of the Venn diagram between computers and some other subject area. Regardless of your academic specialty, fundamental data science skills data are both extremely useful and highly sought after in virtually all career paths. This course aims to give you a primer on data management best practices, analytical processes, and reproducible code. There will also be an opportunity to practice communication of technical concepts to a non-specialist audience.\nThis course is relatively new so I will really appreciate your feedback and participation as we learn together! As such, I may need to adjust the scheduling of various topics (see the schedule for more information), but you will be notified of any changes sufficiently far in advance that you can prepare.\nI would also like to acknowledge that this course has taken place on Wôpanâak (Wampanoag), Massa-adchu-es-et (Massachusett), and Pokanoket land. For more information, please visit www.native-land.ca\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the principles of well-structured data and reproducible coding\nWrite short computer programs (called “scripts”) in R\nExplore data through wrangling and visualization techniques\nAutomate data processes using loops and conditionals\nApply general data science concepts to new datasets\nCreate a professional online presence on GitHub (www.github.com)\nEvaluate peer’s work and offer both useful positive and constructively critical feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Type\nDuration\n\n\n\n\nLecture\n1 hr 15 min\n\n\nLab\n2 hrs 20 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR (www.cran.r-project.org)\n\nI recognize that this website is very bare bones, but this program is the industry standard and enjoys the support of a large and active population of users. When you are troubleshooting (i.e., “debugging”) your code you will very much appreciate the breadth of people who are also using R. Follow the “Download R for …” link for your computer operating system (i.e., Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux) to install R.\n\nRStudio Desktop (www.posit.co/downloads)\n\nRStudio is the preferred platform for working in R; as the R website showed, so-called “base R” can be a little basic. RStudio will provide several helpful bells and whistles that will make the program easier to work with and easier on the eyes!\n\nGit & GitHub\n\nGit (an application like R) and GitHub (a website) will be a part of the course, but you do not need to do anything with them before we cover them in class! Installing Git can be a little annoying for those without command line (a.k.a. “terminal”, “shell”, or “bash”) experience. We’ll cover working with Git and GitHub together a few weeks into the course. If you feel so moved, you are welcome to try to install Git (see instructions here) and make a profile on GitHub on your own, but doing it alone is optional so don’t worry if you can’t get it to work before we cover it in class!\n\nMiscellaneous peer-reviewed articles / book excerpts\n\nI will provide any readings for the course in PDF format, so check the Canvas/etc. page regularly to download the necessary files.

This will help me to share resources we’ll cover in class with you and plan for a smaller in-class community while you are out. My hope is that this class will be somewhere you want to attend, but I understand that sometimes life happens!\nWhile attendance is neither required nor graded, please do not abuse my sympathy and instead reserve absences for days where you honestly cannot attend. Your presence in and contributions to class are important both to your understanding of the material and the creation and maintenance of an in-class community.\n\n\n\nLate work will be accepted with a 10% penalty for each day that it is late. You are welcome to submit assignments that are more than 10 days for feedback so that you can improve going forward but assignments submitted that far after the due date will not be worth any points. If you think that you will struggle to meet a particular deadline, come chat with me as soon as possible so that we can work out whether a compromise would be possible.\n\n\n\nIf needed, the entirety of this course can be taught virtually so I would like to clarify some expectations I have for that modality.
